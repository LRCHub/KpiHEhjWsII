Work hard all day, sleep hard all night
Don't run your mouth if
You don't know how to fight
Plan your work, man, then work your plan
Don't build your house in the sand
Carry a pocket knife, stick to your guns
Know when to walk away but don't ever run
Try not to borrow another man's gold
Gotta answer to the one you owe
These are the things I know
But what do I know? I'm
Just a redneck sitting
On a screened-in sipping on a longneck
Listening to the crickets sing
The same old songs
Like my daddy's granddaddy's daddy's
Daddy did too
What do I know? I'm just a coffee can dollar
Dirt on my hands, sweat on my blue collar
Got everything I need right
Here in the holler
Where the ones that don't get it won't go
What do I know?
Say what you think, think 'fore you speak
Don't kill nothing that ya ain't gonna eat
You learn from the dirt what
Ya street can't teach
That backwoods philosophy
Hell, it still means a lot to me
But what do I know? I'm
Just a redneck sitting
On a screened-in sipping on a longneck
Listening to the crickets sing
The same old songs
Like my daddy's granddaddy's daddy's
Daddy did too
What do I know? I'm just a coffee can dollar
Dirt on my hands, sweat on my blue collar
Got everything I need right
Here in the holler
Where the ones that don't get it won't go
What do I know?
I know wrong, I know right
I know right where I'll go when I die
But what do I know? I'm
Just a redneck sitting
On a screened-in sipping on a longneck
Listening to the crickets sing
The same old songs
Like my daddy's granddaddy's daddy's
Daddy did too
What do I know? I'm just a coffee can dollar
Dirt on my hands, sweat on my blue collar
Got everything I need right
Here in the holler
Where the ones that don't get it won't go
What do I know?
Tell me, what do I know?
