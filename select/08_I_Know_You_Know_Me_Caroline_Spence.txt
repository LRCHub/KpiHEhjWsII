When I go out and try to walk alone
Pretending I don't need a hand to hold
I'm hiding, but I know that you can see
I know you know me

When I am drawing lines in the sand
You are the moon that pulls the tide back in
I rise and fall, you feel the gravity
I know you know me

I know you know, I know you know
I know you know me
I know you know, I know you know
I know you know me

No matter where the storm is in my mind
It'll never be a place that you can't find
You hold the candle, oh, you hold the key
I know you know me

I know you know, I know you know
I know you know me
I know you know, I know you know
I know you know me
I know you know, I know you know
I know you know me
